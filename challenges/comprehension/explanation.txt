Basic Explanation:
The script search through input.txt and returns each alpha numeric grouping of characters (words) once and the number of times it was found.

@ = associative/map array
% = string
$ = array

Detailed Explanation:

First establish how the script should run on command line

Within the main function
@storage is first set as null preparing it for later use
while there are lines available in the file "input.txt" they are assigned to %temp
%temp is then split on each space-character into the array $temp
$temp then contains each split item (will assume "words") from the currently fetched line from "input.txt"

For each item in $temp, being handled as the string %t. %t is checked against a regular expression that will determine if %t contains any number of upper/lower case letters, or numbers.
@storage is then checked for the key of the word if it has already been added to @storage matching key is incremented by 1
if %t is not in @storage, key is set as the current word and its value is assigned to 1.

After iteration of all lines and words, the @storage is looped through
%a references the key, %b represents the value. The key and value are then printed indicating each "words" instances.
